# The Bringhurst theme

## Things you need to know

It's the theme I used, untouched since it's creation. So, there's a lot of stuff that's attributed to myself - information in the footer and whatnot. You'll want to strip it all out.

There's also a Typekit snippet in there - but the kit will only work on my own domain and local domains (such as 127.0.0.1 and localhost). Once again, you'll want to strip that out too.

I'm giving you the opportunity to look at my messy, awful, rushed Wordpress theme development. Enjoy, and don't mock me too much for it. It worked for me, and that's all that matters.
